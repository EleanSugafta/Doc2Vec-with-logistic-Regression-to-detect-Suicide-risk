To examine the performance of the prediction model, used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for pre-processing and Machine Learning methods for training data. 
The model was trained using postings from suicide subreddits. 
Following that, the model's effectiveness was assessed by evaluating portions from notes written by a suicidal individual.
